Tired of reinventing the wheel? So am I. In the fashion of [Awesome React Boilerplates](/awesome-react-boilerplates) `habd.as` is comin' atcha with an all new *evergreen* list of awesome boilerplates—this time for the one and only [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

Let us not waste any more time. Here they are!

**[Atlas](https://github.com/indigotree/atlas)**
<br>I learned about Atlas from a well-timed comment from [`@chrisgeary92`](https://github.com/chrisgeary92) while having a [short discussion](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo/issues/46) about pulling Gulp from Victor Hugo. Like Victor Atlas is heavily integrated with Netlify so it probably won't get you very far with a headless CMS like [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) or [Dato](https://www.datocms.com/). But what you lose in portability you gain in speed to market. Plus it comes with a super cool logo, shown here:

**[Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo)**
<br>Created by the team at Netlify, Victor Hugo is probably the most popular boilerplate for Hugo projects to date. It comes with a Gulp build pipeline and should get you off the ground quickly. Just remember, sometimes you need to [take two steps back](/zero-to-http-2-aws-hugo/) to take a step forward. Cool logo not included.

**[Hugo Lambda](https://github.com/ryansb/hugo-lambda)**
<br>Whilst it isn't actively maintained, the concept behind this boilerplate is sensational—to leverage <abbr title="Function As A Service">FaaS</abbr> tech from Amazon to deploy Hugo under a serverless architecture. If and when I decide to automate deployments with Hugo this is probably the approach I will take. But for now simply run a single task to [deploy from the CLI](/zero-to-http-2-aws-hugo/).

<aside class="notice--success">
  <h4>WTF is Serverless you ask?</h4>
  <p>Learn more about the awesomeness of Serverless architectures in my <b>free</b> <a href="https://habd.as/serverless-email-forwards-ses-lambda-crash-course/">Serverless crash course</a>, where you'll learn just WTF Serverless is, why it's important and have a chance to use Serverless, Lambda and Node to create your own email forwarding service.</p>
</aside>

**[Hugulp](https://github.com/jbrodriguez/hugulp)**
<br>Hugo + Gulp starter kit. Includes BrowserSync, does image optimization stuff, asset fingerprinting (totally not needed if you [deploy Hugo to AWS with CloudFront](/zero-to-http-2-aws-hugo/), your choice between Less and SASS, autoprefixer and more. What's really interesting about this kit is it's inclusion of Docker—probably [my favorite](/simple-websites-jekyll-docker/) DevOps tool ever next to [DevilBox](https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox) or [Helm](https://helm.sh).

**[Huggle](https://github.com/ktmud/huggle)**
<br>Huggle is a generator and a reduced boilerplate mixed into a single tool. Shown here, Huggle churning out a GitHub Pages-friendly Hugo site with a single command from the CLI:

Check out the [Huggle website](http://ktmud.github.io/huggle/) to learn more. Just remember… **[Don't forget the fabric softener](http://amzn.to/2yNJl8w)!**

**[Web Starter Hugo](https://github.com/adrinux/web-starter-hugo)**
<br>This engineering marvel has been around almost as long as Hugo itself but doesn't get much attention. Created by [`@adrinux`](https://github.com/adrinux) Web Starter Hugo bases itself off the one and only [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and includes goodies such as a Gulp build pipeline for responsive image generation, PostCSS and an extensible build of Modernizer. Holy moly that's awesome!!

**[Brunch With Hugo](https://github.com/Jayphen/brunch-with-hugo)**
<br>Are tools like Webpack [starting to feel](https://medium.com/@jhabdas/webpack-is-your-achilles-heel-d3cd80821a4f) like your Achilles’ heel? Then this is the boilerplate for you. Created by my man main [`@Jayphen`](https://github.com/Jayphen/) and leveraging the deceptively simple and ultra fast [Brunch by Paul Miller](http://brunch.io/) and friends, BWH provides BrowserSync and plugs right in with the entire Brunch ecosystem to help you get to where you're going without dealing with tooling trivialities.

**[After Dark](https://github.com/comfusion/after-dark)**
<br>No awesome list would be complete if I didn't selfishly promote some of of my own stuff amirite!? I built after Dark specifically to create my [Hack Cabin](https://hackcabin.com) website. It uses a design concept I call _Deceptive Simplicity_ and introduces cutting edge Web technologies without going overboard of the tooling. [Check it out](https://comfusion.github.io/after-dark/) for a trip back in time, when Geocities and Angelfire reined supreme.

**[Tranquil Peak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme)**
<br>Wait, can Hugo themes also be boilerplates??? You bet they can! And this one from first-time Java dev turned Web dude introduces a sophisticated and highly extensible theme and build toolkit all roped into one. Check out the [demo site](https://tranquilpeak.kakawait.com/) then click the title link above to dig into the source code.
