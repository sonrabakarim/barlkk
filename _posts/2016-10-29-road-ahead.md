When I started this blog back in 2008 I didn't have a clear direction for what I wanted it to be. I just knew at the time I was working on closed source software and, without it, had no other way to convey my skills to potential employers and clients.

Over time the content direction for the blog became clearer. It eventually grew to become a tech tutorials site and [made open source](https://github.com/jhabdas/habd.as). It serves as a journal both for the community and a place for me to scribe how to do things I knew I'd otherwise forget. It worked, and has served both purposes well.

After [deciding to leave the corporate world][1] earlier this year in favor of a path less conventional I realized this site was not the proper place to tell that story. And so I created a **new website to start documenting the freelance journey**. The new website name was inspired by one Ean Platter, curator of the fantastic [React Newsletter](http://reactjsnewsletter.com/), during our time together at TechnologyAdvice--it's called Hack Cabin.

[Hack Cabin](http://hackcabin.com) is a static website built using AWS and Hugo. To get acquainted, read about the [site architecture](http://hackcabin/post/initial-commit/) or why I suggest others [Choose Hugo Over Jekyll](/choose-hugo-over-jekyll/).

And if you're not interested in technology I'll also be writing about [travel](hackcabin.com/post/bali-travel-survival-guide/) and freelancing on Hack Cabin. So check it out if you're interested in [gaining independence][1] in the way you work, and quietly slipping away from your corporate overlords.

To the road ahead, wherever it may lead.
